#How to find a good balance between stocks, bonds, and crypto?
The rule of thumb advisors have traditionally urged investors to use, in terms of the percentage of stocks an investor should have in their portfolio; this equation suggests, for example, that a 30-year-old would hold 70% in stocks, 30% in bonds, while a 60-year-old would have 40% in stocks, 60% in bonds.Will It Work for Every Investor?
Now, it’s important to point out that the Oracle of Omaha didn’t say that the 90/10 split makes sense for every investor. The larger point he was trying to make was about the makeup of portfolios, not the precise allocation. His main contention was that most investors will get better returns through low-cost, low-turnover index funds, an interesting admission for someone who’s made a fortune picking individual stocks.According to Estrada’s research, the safest asset mix was actually 60% stocks and 40% bonds, which had a remarkable 0% failure rate.(Investopedia, updated by Daniel Kurt october30, 2020)
#What kind of Algorithms we should create and models to do so?

Income, Balanced and Growth Asset Allocation Models
We can divide asset allocation models into three broad groups:

•  Income Portfolio: 70% to 100% in bonds.

•  Balanced Portfolio: 40% to 60% in stocks.

•  Growth Portfolio: 70% to 100% in stocks.
STOCKS, BONDS AND CRYPTOCURRENCY
HISTORICAL GROWTH
stocks and bonds
The historical returns for stocks is between 8% – 10% since 1926. The historical returns for bonds is between 4% – 6% since 1926. Both asset classes have performed well over time. The key is figuring what combination works best for your risk tolerance and financial objectives.
The Future of Cryptocurrency
(https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/future-of-cryptocurrency/)
We can speculate on what value cryptocurrency may have for investors in the coming months and years (and many will), but the reality is it’s still a new and speculative investment, without much history on which to base predictions. No matter what a given expert thinks or says, no one really knows. That’s why it’s important to only invest what you’re prepared to lose, and stick to more conventional investments for long-term wealth building.
Investments That Provide Various Levels Of Risk & Return
(https://www.financialsamurai.com/historical-returns-of-different-stock-bond-portfolio-weightings/)
Zero risk: Treasury bonds held to maturity, money market accounts, and CDs where the FDIC guarantees up to $250,000 in losses per person.

Minimal risk: The highest rated municipal bonds in your state. You can find 20-year municipal bonds yielding 4%+ federal and state tax free. AAA-rated municipal bonds have default rates under 1%. In 15.5 years, you’ll double your money. So long as you hold your municipal bond until maturity, you will get all your principal back plus the annual coupon, if the municipality doesn’t go bankrupt.

Municipal Bond Default Rates By Grade

Moderate risk: The Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index provides about a 5% annual return each year, depending on which 10 year time frame you’re looking at. You can take more risk buying individual corporate bonds, emerging market bonds, or high yield bonds. But overall, buying the aggregate bond index is a moderately risky investment.
Higher risk: The stock market has returned anywhere from 8% – 10% a year on average, depending on the time frame you are looking at. Just like in the bond market, you can buy all sorts of different stocks with different risk profiles. But as we know, the stock market can have violent corrections. See the recent number and magnitude of corrections below in the chart.
Retirees will have a combination of different types of risk levels. The question to ask is what type of investment weightings one should have in each based on their risk profile.


There is no right answer because everybody’s risk tolerance is different.

<P>Hello World!  My name is Kevin Mau and I am part of the front-end development team of RoCry.  More specifically, 
I engineered and implemented the cute little robot that loves to talk with our visitors!  You can find our RoCry chatbot 
by clicking on the widget on the bottom right corner of our webpage.  My plans for the future for our blue-colored friend 
would be to expand his capabilites to navigate our visitors to more and more resources found on our webpage.  Also he 
will be able to collect more specific information to uniquely tailor to the user-experience.  Ultimately, if the user 
permits, we want that our RoCry Bot to know the user's intentions so well that the RoCry Bot can execute trades on the 
user's behalf.  Thank you for visiting and I hope that you are enjoying the RoCry platform.

And here's a mugshot of me</p>

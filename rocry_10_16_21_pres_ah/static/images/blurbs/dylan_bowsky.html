<p>Hi everyone, my name is Dylan Bowsky. I have worked in the finance field for the last 8 years 
and have thoroughly enjoyed educating people and learning about finance. I have been working as a banker 
and have seem some things that big and small banks are lacking. Noticing this lack in the current market is 
what made me think of RoCry. RoCry is a platform to use Crypto as a diversifier in your portfolio along with 
stocks and bonds. We are using Machine Learning to learn from data on a daily level and see how our portfolios 
can keep getting better. Our portfolios at the current time are preset and were hand picked using background 
and historical data. The intent is used to use a well-rounded portfolio to start so the novice investor doesnâ€™t 
get overwhelmed by the vast market. We include portfolios based of risk tolerance for the user to decide using 
our ChatBot. I am excited to further this project and continue to provide a service to all types of investors.
Also be sure to check our ones to watch which is using a neural network model to pick up on trends for our 
top picks of the week.</p>
